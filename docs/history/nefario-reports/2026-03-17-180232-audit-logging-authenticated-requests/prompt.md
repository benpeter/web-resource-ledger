**Outcome**: Full audit trail of authenticated API activity — who captured what, when, with which key — enabling abuse investigation and compliance reporting for multi-tenant operation.

**Success criteria**:
- All authenticated API requests logged with tenant context (tenantId, keyId, action, resource)
- Key provisioning and revocation events logged
- Log entries integrate with existing Coralogix structured logging
- Audit trail queryable by tenant and time range in Coralogix

**Scope**:
- In: Structured log entries on every authenticated request, key lifecycle events, integration with existing log() helper
- Out: Audit log export API, compliance report generation, log retention policies

**Constraints**:
- Depends on R12 (per-tenant keys) — audit logging is meaningful only with tenant identity
