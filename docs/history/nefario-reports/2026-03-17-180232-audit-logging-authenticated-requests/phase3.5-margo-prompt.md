You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-i3EPD4/audit-logging-authenticated-requests/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
- Over-engineering: Is the plan doing more than necessary for the stated goal?
- YAGNI violations: Are there features, abstractions, or infrastructure being added speculatively?
- Dependency bloat: Does the plan introduce unnecessary new dependencies or abstractions?
- Scope creep: Is anything being built that wasn't asked for?
- Simplification opportunities: Can any tasks be combined, removed, or simplified?
- Operational burden: Does the plan add unnecessary operational complexity?

## Original User Request
Read the original user request from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-i3EPD4/audit-logging-authenticated-requests/prompt.md

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:

- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.

- ADVISE: Return warnings using this format for each concern:
  - [your-domain]: <one-sentence description>
    SCOPE: <file, component, or concept affected>
    CHANGE: <what should change, in domain terms>
    WHY: <risk or rationale, self-contained>
    TASK: <task number affected>

  Each advisory must be understandable by a reader who has not seen the plan
  or this review session. SCOPE names the artifact, not a plan step number.
  CHANGE and WHY use domain terms, not plan-internal references.

- BLOCK: Return using this format:
  SCOPE: <file, component, or concept affected>
  ISSUE: <description of the blocking concern>
  RISK: <what happens if this is not addressed>
  SUGGESTION: <how the plan could be revised>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-i3EPD4/audit-logging-authenticated-requests/phase3.5-margo.md
