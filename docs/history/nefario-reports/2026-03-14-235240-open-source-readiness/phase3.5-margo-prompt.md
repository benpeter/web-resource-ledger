You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-2Ir2JF/open-source-readiness/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI violations, unnecessary complexity, scope creep. Specifically:
- Is anything in the plan beyond the 8 stated steps?
- Are the community docs (CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) appropriately scoped or bloated?
- Is the CI workflow minimal as required (no matrix, no coverage, no deploy)?
- Are there unnecessary abstractions or over-designed elements?
- Does the evolution log entry (Task 2) stay factual or drift into unnecessary narrative?
- Is anything being built speculatively (not needed yet)?
