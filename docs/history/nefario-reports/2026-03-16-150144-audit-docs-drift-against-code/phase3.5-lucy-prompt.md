You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ieySxD/audit-docs-drift-against-code/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
- Convention adherence: Do the task prompts follow project conventions from CLAUDE.md?
- CLAUDE.md compliance: Does the plan respect the evolution log requirement, engineering philosophy (YAGNI, KISS, Lean and Mean)?
- Intent drift: Does the plan match the user's original intent (audit docs for drift, fix or file issues)?
- Scope compliance: Does the plan stay within the stated scope (no evolution log edits, no external docs)?
- Are there any tasks that go beyond what was requested?
