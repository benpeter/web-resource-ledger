You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ILArQV/static-verification-page/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Security gaps in the execution plan: XSS vectors (captured URL display, textContent vs innerHTML, URL scheme validation), CSP header correctness (unsafe-inline decision, connect-src, img-src), cache poisoning risks (Vary: Accept on both paths), information disclosure in noscript fallback, content negotiation edge cases that could bypass security headers.

## Original User Request

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:

- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.

- ADVISE: Return warnings using this format for each concern:
  - [your-domain]: <one-sentence description>
    SCOPE: <file, component, or concept affected>
    CHANGE: <what should change, in domain terms>
    WHY: <risk or rationale, self-contained>
    TASK: <task number affected>

- BLOCK: Return using this format:
  SCOPE: <file, component, or concept affected>
  ISSUE: <description of the blocking concern>
  RISK: <what happens if this is not addressed>
  SUGGESTION: <how the plan could be revised>

Each advisory must be understandable by a reader who has not seen the plan
or this review session. SCOPE names the artifact, not a plan step number.
CHANGE and WHY use domain terms, not plan-internal references.

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ILArQV/static-verification-page/phase3.5-security-minion.md
