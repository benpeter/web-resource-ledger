You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-xrXhca/staging-deploy-race-condition/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat. Specifically:
- Is the concurrency group necessary for a solo developer project?
- Is the traceability logging step justified or gold-plating?
- Are there simpler ways to achieve the same outcome?
- Is the plan doing more than what was asked (scope creep)?
- Are the two tasks correctly scoped or should they be combined?
