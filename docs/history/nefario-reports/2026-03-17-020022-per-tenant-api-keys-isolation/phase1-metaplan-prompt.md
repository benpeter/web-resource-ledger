MODE: META-PLAN

You are creating a meta-plan — a plan for who should help plan.

## Task
<github-issue>
**Outcome**: A second operator can use WRL with their own API key. Captures are isolated by tenant. Key compromise affects only one tenant. The single static key becomes the first tenant's key — no breaking change to existing clients.

**Success criteria**:
- KV-based key lookup (`kv.get("apikey:{sha256}")` → `{ tenantId, scopes }`)
- Per-tenant capture isolation (tenant can only list/retrieve their own captures)
- Read/write key scoping (capture vs read-only keys)
- Key provisioning tooling (CLI or admin endpoint)
- Migration path for existing captures (tagged to "default" tenant via R8)
- v1 API contract unbroken — existing single key works as first tenant key
- Per-IP rate limiting retained as secondary control alongside per-tenant

**Scope**:
- In: New auth module (KV key lookup), tenant tagging in KV records, tenant-scoped list endpoint, key scoping, provisioning tooling, capture migration
- Out: OAuth, social signup, RBAC beyond read/write, admin web UI, billing

**Constraints**:
- Gated on multi-user decision — do not build until a second user is real or imminent
- R1 (list endpoint) and R8 (auth identity enrichment) must ship first
- Security-minion recommends per-tenant keys + isolation + scoping as a single PR, audit logging as follow-on

Additional context: look at #42, there seems to be no plan what the admin key is. is that implicitly tenant 1? also, key provisioning must happen via admin API, not CLI. if CLI at all then later and it would work with the admin API

## External Skill Discovery
Before analyzing the task, scan for project-local skills. If skills are
discovered, include an "External Skill Integration" section in your meta-plan
(see your Core Knowledge for the output format).

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the codebase context
2. Discover external skills:
   a. Scan .claude/skills/ and .skills/ in the working directory for SKILL.md files
   b. Read frontmatter (name, description) for each discovered skill
   c. For skills whose description matches the task domain, classify as
      ORCHESTRATION or LEAF (see External Skill Integration in your Core Knowledge)
   d. Check the project's CLAUDE.md for explicit skill preferences
   e. Include discovered skills in your meta-plan output
3. Analyze the task against your delegation table
4. Identify which specialists should be CONSULTED FOR PLANNING
   (not execution — planning). These are agents whose domain
   expertise is needed to create a good plan.
5. For each specialist, write a specific planning question that
   draws on their unique expertise.
6. Return the meta-plan in the structured format.
7. Write your complete meta-plan to `/var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-boFNSO/per-tenant-api-keys-isolation/phase1-metaplan.md`
